# **Approach**
A small, experimental game, in which you move about amongst others, freely deciding whether you want to approach anyone or not. They might become your friend, enemy or not care at all. You decide whether it is worth the risk and what it all meant in the end.

This was originally a research project for behaviour tree based AI systems.

## *3rd party Frameworks*
These are freely accessible on github. They are included in this project, as there is no decent package management yet for those in Unity.
* UniRx -> [github](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
* Zenject -> [github](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)

The behaviour tree system is based on [Fluent Behaviour Tree](https://github.com/ashleydavis/Fluent-Behaviour-Tree) and was slightly modified in this project.

## *Builds*
